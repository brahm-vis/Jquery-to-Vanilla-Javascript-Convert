# Jquery-to-Vanilla-Javascript-Convert
This JavaScript library facilitates the conversion of jQuery code to Vanilla JavaScript. While jQuery is a powerful and extensive library, moving to Vanilla JavaScript can enhance performance and reduce load times. We've covered a comprehensive set of functions, but there may be some functions that we missed. We welcome contributions to help improve and expand the library.
