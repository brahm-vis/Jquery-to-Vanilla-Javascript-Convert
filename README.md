# Jquery-to-Vanilla-Javascript-Convert
This Javascript Library can be used to convert Jquery codes to Vanilla Js Codes . jQuery is a vast and extensive library, and while we've made an effort to cover a comprehensive set of functions, there may be some functions that we missed in the conversion. Together we can improve it. Help us to improve it..
